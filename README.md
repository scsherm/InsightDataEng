These programs are designed to collect a word count for each unique word and calculate the running median of words per line for all text files in the wc_input directory.

In order for the programs (written in python) to work correctly the following steps must be followed:

1. Your working directory must be set to the location of the "src", "wc input", and "wc output" sub-directories.  

2. The programs must be executed from terminal with the run.sh file, or the appropriate arguments must be called in terminal for the sys.argv function in the python script. The second and third calls of the run.sh file are designed to be used with the "wc input" and "wc output" sub-directories.
